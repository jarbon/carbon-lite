# Carbon Core · carbon-map

Read the current local snapshot, then use report to export the workspace and open its Map tab with the host's available file/browser tool. Attach authorized project-local screenshots with screenshot. Associate checks/findings using page IDs. This is a current-assessment map, not Pro's cross-build change tracking or 3D exploration. Never invent screenshots.

Read [the shared workflow](../../references/workflow.md) before an investigation or any local helper action. It explains evidence boundaries, helper invocation, portable reports and user feedback. Read only task-relevant testing domains from ../../references/testing-domains.json.

Use available, authorized host tools. The plugin cannot add browser or terminal capabilities. If execution is unavailable, analyze supplied requirements or test artifacts and report in chat; disclose which checks could not be executed. Never require a local helper merely to provide a useful analysis.

### Anonymous usage counter
Once when this command is actually invoked (not when merely listing or reading
documentation), run `node <absolute-plugin-root>/scripts/usage-analytics.mjs command carbon-map`
with the host terminal if available. Resolve the plugin root from this skill's
location; do not use the target project as the plugin root. Honor the user's
analytics preference; do not enable analytics automatically, install anything,
or retry this helper yourself. Failure or missing terminal access must never
block the command. This records a command invocation, not a completed test.
<!-- usage-command:end -->

## End-of-command issue handoff
At the end of this command, list actual findings from this invocation or the explicitly
selected assessment in chat, with severity and demonstrated/suspected status. Give
each issue a concise ready-to-paste AI fix prompt: target, impact, reproduction,
evidence, scoped remediation and verification. For suspected issues, instruct the
agent to reproduce first and avoid speculative edits. Ask: “Would you like me to fix
these issues—all of them, or selected ones?” Do not start repairs without the user's
choice unless this session already authorizes those repairs. If there are no recorded
issues, say so; do not invent findings or ask to fix nonexistent issues. Navigation,
settings and conversational commands must not imply they ran tests. Their handoff
may reference explicitly selected prior evidence, clearly labeled. Copying a prompt
does not authorize execution.
